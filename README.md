# ⚽ Soccer Data Engineering Pipeline.

A hands-on data engineering project that ingests real-time soccer data from a public API, stores raw JSON files, transforms the data into a normalized schema, and loads it into a data warehouse. The project is orchestrated using Apache Airflow and containerized with Docker.

---

## 📌 Project Scope

- Ingest soccer match, team, and player data via a public REST API.
- Store raw JSON data in a data lake layer (local or AWS S3).
- Load and normalize data into a PostgreSQL-based warehouse.
- Use dbt to define transformation logic and maintain schema integrity.
- Schedule and orchestrate pipelines using Apache Airflow.
- Containerize all components with Docker for reproducibility.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/soccer-pipeline.git
cd soccer-pipeline
```

### 2. Add Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project:

```
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Run Locally with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- Airflow UI: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- pgAdmin (if used): [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050)
